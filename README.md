License Notes on parts:

  png/
     some files taken from gfpoken/png or gfpoken/art (licensed GPL v2?)
       then scaled up to 64 x 64 pixels (is this really any kind of change
                                         needing a copyright?   don't think so)
     some modified by me (changes can go under GPL v2 or Unlicense)
        see bits-of-gfpoken project...
        
  some code created by me (all under Unlicense)
        the *.py files


General Information:

ngfp aka new gfpoken aka gfpoken-in-python is my learning project for python, 
pyglet and many other things (I'm not that familiar with git or Debian 
packaging and ...).  So be gentle with me here ok?  :)


To make spacing consistent I've used:

 # to see what the changes would look like:
 $ autopep8 . --recursive --select=E101,E121 --diff

 # to make the changes:
 $ autopep8 . --recursive --select=E101,E121 --in-place
