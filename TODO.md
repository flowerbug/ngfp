v0.0.0 - v0.0.2
  initial import of code so far and a few basic changes

v0.0.3-? this TODO

  - grab widgets and put on guess board (works)
  - update counts text (works for placing but not the other way yet)
  - moving items (working on now/next)
  - removing items from board to go back to widget piles (now/next/maybe)

  - game logic
    - putting a marble in motion
    - detecting where it comes out
    - basic history
    - markers
    - comparing boards
      - exact match is easy
      - functional match is harder

  - configuration file
  - save and load games
  - restructure code (encapsulate, objectify, clean it up, tests and comments)


  (I'm not planning on doing networking version at this time)

  Bugs and comments to ant@anthive.com - I'm not always checking
issues here on Salsa as of yet I haven't spent much time figuring
out all the mechanisms of projects/issues/merges/pulls/etc.
