v0.1.0 - ?  This TODO

  - comparing boards
    - exact match is easy
    - functional match is harder

  - configuration file
  - save and load games
  - restructure code (encapsulate, objectify, clean it up, tests and comments)


v0.0.9

  - fix label code a bit (works)
    - can use label.text to change label

  - some animation or way of showing what happens on guess board (works)


v0.0.8

  - a bit of fun showing where the marble is bouncing
    around in the game - this doesn't stay in the final
    version, but i may leave it in as an option/toggle
    anyways because it might help in debugging...
