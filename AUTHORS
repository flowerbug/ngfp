Notes from ant@anthive.com are above the =====

The AUTHORS file from gfpoken (edited to only include 
references to artwork/graphics since it that is all 
that is included/used in the python code):

I did rescale the artwork from 32 to 64 pixels and
fixed one image (see other project:

https://salsa.debian.org/ant-guest/bits-of-gfpoken

All of my own new images and changes to existing images
are very simple and have no copyright.

If anyone ever actually really cares about this you
will have to either go back and trace the history of
each file looking at the gfpoken source code/history
or come up with new artwork/files (I'm not going to 
do that unless absolutely required...).
